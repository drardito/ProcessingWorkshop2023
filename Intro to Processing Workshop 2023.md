[Processing](https://processing.org/) is a computer programming language, originally based on Java, which was designed to provide a toolkit for artists and others to create 2-D and 3-D images and animations. You can also use Processing to create interactive media and even games.

### What are we up to?

The goal of this 8-week program is to learn the basics of Processing in order to create all kinds of images (2-D, 3-D, interactive, animations, etc.). 

### How will we work together?

We will be focused on making things with Processing, and in doing so, we will learn the basics of the language as well as many of its more complicated and advanced functionality.

### Program Schedule (subject to change)

1. **Week 1** - Introduction to Processing and online Processing Coding Environment
2. **Week 2** - Basic Lines, Shapes, and Colors
3. **Week 3** - 2-D Graphics and Animation
4. **Week 4** - Advanced Graphics and Animation
5. **Week 5** - Working with Sound and Video
6. **Week 6**- Building something cool, part 1
7. **Week 7** - Building something cool, part 2
8. **Week 8** - Show and Tell - What did we learn? What can be our next steps?
